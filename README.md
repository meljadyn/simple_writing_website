# A Writing Tips Website
This is a simple website made with just HTML and CSS. I've been doing a lot of work with frameworks lately and it's occurred to me that my base understandning of HTML and CSS was lacking because of it. I went back to the basics for this project and made a website using just the HTML/CSS.

I only had a few hours to do it, but I think it turned out rather alright considering, and it really did help nail in more of those fundamentals.

Note for the curious:
The advice on this website is real, but honestly very brief. I was padding space to meet project requirements rather than thoughtfully writing detailed tips on fiction writing. You've been warned.
